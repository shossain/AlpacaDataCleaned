{"id": "seed_task_0", "scenario": "Instruction: Write a military training scenario for a rifle platoon commander for Fox Company, Battalion Landing Team 2/1, 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) deployed in Africa.\n\nInput: You are reinforcing the US Embassy, in Blueland's civil war,. Receive reports of civilians and armed rebels, and consider the rules of engagement that allow proportional force to defend US citizens.\n\nOutput:  You are a rifle platoon commander  (13th MEU(SOC)) operating in the African country of Blueland. Your platoon has been sent ashore to reinforce the American Embassy in the nation's capital, Blueland City. Blueland is in the middle of a civil war between the pro-U.S. democratic government and rebel forces known as the \"Zebras\" because of the distinctive black and white utilities they wear. The Zebras have small arms, primarily AK-47s. The violence has escalated to the point where the Embassy staff may be in danger despite the presence of a 10-man Marine security guard (MSG) detachment.\nAt the MEU confirmation brief prior to the launch, the MEU lawyer, or staff judge advocate, spelled out the rules of engagement (ROE). He said that: (1) the Zebras had been \"declared hostile\"; (2) \"proportional force\" was authorized to defend U.S. forces, the Embassy staff, and any other U.S. citizen against any \"hostile act\" or demonstration of \"hostile intent\"; (3) tear gas and pepper spray were not authorized; and (4) all efforts must be made to \"minimize collateral damage.\"\nYou have no attachments or detachments. You have your organic platoon weapons-M16s, M203s, M249s, 9mm pistols-as well as nonlethal weapons to include shields, batons, stinger grenades, beanbag rounds, and rubber bullets. A forward command element (FCE) consisting of the MEU executive officer, two other officers, and three radio operators inserted into the Embassy 3 days prior to conduct liaison with the U.S. Ambassador. The MSG Marines have already spread concertina wire around the perimeter.\nYou inserted via helicopter into the Embassy compound, did some quick coordination with the FCE, and then established three hasty squad defensive positions along the Embassy perimeter. The MSG Marines are inside the Embassy building itself.\nOnce you were satisfied with your initial defensive scheme you went back into the Embassy to conduct more detailed coordination with the FCE. Within a matter of minutes, two of your squad leaders are trying to reach you via radio.\n1st Squad, at the northern end of the compound, reports that a group of five men are standing about 30 meters away smoking cigarettes. They are wearing the same black and white utilities that the S-2 had briefed and have AK-47s slung on their shoulders. The squad leader is requesting guidance.\n2d Squad, at the southern end of the compound, reports that a group of about 50 civilians is within 20 meters of their position shouting and waving their fists at the Marines. A few civilians are throwing rocks at the squad. The Ambassador overhears the conversation and mentions that his MSG Marines have tear gas grenades and pepper spray canisters that your Marines can use to disperse the crowd.\n\nLocation: 32.88113 N, 13.19039 E"}
{"id": "seed_task_1", "scenario": "Instruction: Write a scenario for a pilot in the Air Force conducting a bombing run in south-east Asia. \n\nInput: A terrorist group is known to be holding hostages in a remote jungle location. Receive information about the terrorist group's location and any potential civilian presence in the area.\n\nOutput: You are a pilot in the Air Force flying over south-east Asia on a mission to conduct a bombing run on a remote jungle location. Intelligence reports indicate that a terrorist group has been holding hostages in the area and are using it as a base to plan attacks in surrounding regions. As you approach the target area, you receive updated information from ground forces regarding the situation on the ground.\n- The terrorist group is known to possess anti-aircraft weapons, so expect heavy resistance.\n- Satellite imagery suggests that there may be civilian settlements nearby that could be impacted by the bombing run.\n- Intelligence also indicates that the terrorists may have hostages in the immediate area around the target location.\n- Ground forces have provided an exact location for the hostages, marked on your map with a red circle.\nAs you approach the target area, you can see the dense jungle landscape below and the potential challenges that lie ahead. Your goal is to ensure the safety of the hostages but also to neutralize the terrorist group to prevent any future attacks.\nYou must carefully consider the information you have received in order to conduct the most effective bombing run while minimizing civilian casualties. Here are some possible scenarios and decisions you may need to make:\n- Scenario 1: You have located the terrorist group's base and have a clear shot. However, ground forces report that there is a high likelihood of civilian settlements within the blast range. Do you proceed with the bombing run and risk civilian casualties or abort the mission?\n- Scenario 2: As you approach the target area, you spot the hostages marked on the map. However, they are located dangerously close to the terrorist base. Do you change your attack strategy to avoid harming the hostages or proceed as planned?\n- Scenario 3: The anti-aircraft weapons on the ground open fire as you approach. Do you respond with a full-scale attack or attempt to maneuver and avoid the incoming fire?\nAs a pilot, you must make quick decisions under pressure and take calculated risks to ensure mission success. The lives of the hostages, ground forces, and civilians are in your hands. Your actions will determine the outcome of this crucial mission. How will you handle the challenge?\n\nLocation: 17.57964 N, 98.70381 E."}
