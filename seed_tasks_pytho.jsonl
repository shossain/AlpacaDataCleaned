U.S. forces have been conducting offensive operations as part of a multinational coalition in the desert country of Kartiq. The United Nations coalition is operating under a resolution intended to remove the oppressive Kartiqi dictator from power in order to return stability to the region. Military resistance has been light thus far. While the majority of the Kartiqi population despises their leader, they remain skeptical of American interests in the area. Locals have generally tried to avoid U.S. forces and have not yet demonstrated any open opposition. However, if convinced they were becoming the direct target of military action, they would likely rise up in defense of the homeland. Aware of this fact, the Kartiqi military has increased its presence in urban areas in hopes of drawing the local populace into the conflict.\nA week ago the regiment seized the town of Rikala. 1/6 has assumed responsibility for maintaining the town's security as the remainder of the regiment pushes north. The battalion has subdivided the town into four quadrants with Company A occupying the northwest. The company's mission is to control Quadrant Alpha in order to prevent the enemy from infiltrating back and reestablishing power. The company has established checkpoints on the outskirts of town, conducted searches of suspected hideouts, and demonstrated its presence with aggressive urban patrolling. Two reaction forces are always available on 10-minute alert: a rifle platoon from your company and a HMMWV-mounted heavy machinegun section from the battalion. Because the United States is at war with Kartiq, the rules of engagement are much less restrictive now than in the past. Servicemembers are authorized to engage the Kartiqi military by any means consistent with the law of war. Nonmilitary personnel observed committing serious crimes will be detained using minimal force necessary. If all reasonable graduated response techniques have been exhausted, and it appears that human life will be lost, deadly force is authorized. Self-defense is always authorized.\nYour platoon has been tasked with conducting a patrol through the quadrant in order to deter renewed enemy action and report on suspicious activity. Advancing north along the streets, you observe a crowd of approximately 15 Kartiqi locals about 2 blocks away, engaged in what appears to be an intense argument. As you approach, they cast a few glares your way but otherwise leave you alone. Thinking better than to continue in that direction, you instead turn west and report the situation to higher. After advancing one block to the west, you notice a large open lot to your front and again decide to detour around this potential danger area. Turning north and then west again, you finally find yourself on a safer route.\nYour movement standing operating procedure has been a typical \"two up, one back\" double column. Your lead squads advance along either side of the road, staggered with respect to each other, providing security to the front and opposite flanks. 3d Squad is moving in trace of 1st while also providing rear security. As you come to the next intersection, you treat it as a danger area and manage to get 1st and 2d Squads across safely. As you prepare to cross with 3d Squad, a rifle shot suddenly breaks the silence, and a Marine from 2d Squad crumples to the ground. \"Sniper!\"\nYou know the shot came from the north side but can't tell from which building. The two squads appear to be executing your immediate action drill. 1st Squad scrambles for the southern buildings to provide suppression while 2d Squad conducts an immediate assault to the north, dragging the downed Marine inside. As the squads disappear from view, you hear tremendous fire erupting from the southern buildings. Apparently 1st Squad has run into a fight of its own. \"Ambushed!\" you think to yourself. You and your 3d Squad are still east of the intersection. You shout to the other two squads but get no response.\n\nLocation: 31.05582 N, 46.2502 E"}

Your specific orders are to prevent unauthorized ethnic Albanians from crossing to the south of the bridge and entering the Seth section of town, where several dozen Serb families still remain in residence, as well as preventing Serbs, without authorization, from transiting north. The bridge is of stone construction, designed for pedestrians and horse-cart traffic.

Your command is deployed as follows: 3d Squad, with the M240 team, is in fighting positions just south of the bridge. Three men from 3d Squad man a checkpoint at the northern entrance to the bridge. 2d Squad, along with your command element and two interpreters, are deployed around a partially ruined stone building to the south of 3d's position. Some 10 minutes ago, Ist Squad began to make its way back to the chow line to the rear, for the only hot meal of the day.\nAs you wonder what is on tonight's menu, the checkpoint comes on the net. \"Sir, some 50 Albanians, including several women and some men who act drunk, are at the north end of the square heading toward the bridge. Three men and a woman are in the lead. I can make out several AK47s and hunting rifles. Over.\"\nIn the waning light, you scan the lead group with your binoculars. You immediately recognize the face of Shefki Mahti from pictures circulated by the battalion S2. He is an ex-major in the Kosovo Liberation Army who is believed to be running death squads against former Serb leaders and those alleged to have committed crimes over the past months against Albanians and their property. The others are unknown to you. The ex-major is also the darling of the Western press having given several headlinemaking interviews in recent days. Not surprisingly a CNN television crew pulls up in a European style subcompact and rapidly deploys to begin filming the crowd and your positions. Through an interpreter you issue the following warning: \"You are approaching a KFOR permit area-one closed at this hour regardless of KFOR permit. Disperse immediately! Do not attempt to cross the bridge!\"\nWith the crowd still advancing, the exmajor through his own bullhorn answers you in English. \"We are coming for the Serb bastard who killed my sister's husband and raped my niece and the daughters and wives of these men.

The area is known to have terrorist activity and the convoy has received intelligence indicating an imminent attack. The Major in charge must make quick decisions to protect the convoy and soldiers under his/her command.","output": "It is 0900 and the convoy has been moving for 2 hours. You are an Army Major in charge of the convoy consisting of 10 Humvees and 2 MRAPs in a mountainous region in the Middle East. The terrain is difficult with narrow roads winding through steep hills. Your convoy is vulnerable to ambush from higher ground. Intelligence has indicated that a terrorist group, known for their use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and small arms fire, is planning to attack the convoy with an IED planted on the road. Their number and exact location are unknown. The convoy has encountered a roadblock set up by the terrorists blocking the road ahead in an S-shape designed to funnel the vehicles into a kill zone. Your convoy is equipped with dismounted QRFs (Quick Reaction Forces) and is receiving support from a drone providing video surveillance with the ability to drop ordinance in close proximity to the convoy.\n\nJust then, the drone reports a group of armed men approaching from a hill to the west, approximately 500 meters away. You assess that the group is likely part of the terrorist cell planning to attack the convoy.\n\nRequirement\n\nIn a time limit of 5 minutes, detail the orders you give to your convoy and your report to headquarters.
